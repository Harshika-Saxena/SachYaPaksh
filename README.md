# SachYaPaksh
SachYaPaksh is an AI-powered media analysis tool designed to detect and flag bias in real-time. By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and fined-tuned DistilBERT model, the platform helps users distinguish between objective reporting and biased influence.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Backend:** Developed in **Python** to handle real-time data ingestion.
* **Data Pipeline:** Custom logic scrapes live news via APIs and structures raw data into **JSON format** for seamless processing.
* **AI Model:** Utilizes a fine-tuned **DistilBERT** Transformer architecture for high-accuracy sequence classification.
* **Bias Detection:** Calculates a "Bias Confidence Score" based on narrative portrayal and sentiment analysis.

## ⚡ Core Modules
* **FairFeed:** A real-time news scanner that identifies and flags skewed headlines and narrative slants.
* **DocuCheck:** An inference engine that acts as a mirror for content creators to identify harmful generalizations in their own writing.
* **TrueView:** A visual analysis tool using **OCR** to extract text from posters and ads to find hidden representation gaps.



## 🔮 Roadmap & Vision
We are currently scaling SachYaPaksh toward real-time video analysis and browser extensions. Our goal is to reclaim the truth by making unbiased media analysis accessible to everyone, one click at a time.
